# PHP scripts
These are all individual, stand-alone scripts that just might be useful to people. Each script includes an explanatory comment at the top.

## Support
I'm an advocate of open source, FOSS, FSF, and such. Like all other scripts and tools within this repository, this code is provided for free in the hopes it's useful to somebody. If you found this helpful and want to show your support, donations are always greatly appreciated.
