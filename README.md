# Useful-scripts
Potentially useful scripts by QWeb Ltd

As a web and game development company, from time to time we create scripts for ourselves that turn out to be potentially useful to others, so I'm going to start uploading some of these scripts in the hopes they do indeed prove useful to somebody else out there.

Don't expect this repository to grow very rapidly, and don't expect any of these scripts to be updated often.

Everything here is released freely under the GNU GPL v3. Take what you like and evolve into great things, but please get in touch if our code ends up in something cool =).
